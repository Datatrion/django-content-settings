# Glossary

Some of the terms used in other articles are explained here. The terms from glossary are showed in *italic* in the other articles.

In order to better understand those terms, I'll use the following example.

```python
FAVORITE_SUBJECTS = SimpleStringsList(
    "mysubject",
    comment_starts_with="//",
    help="my favorive songs subjects"
)
```

* **admin preview** or **setting admin preview** - when the admin changes the *raw value* in Django Admin, the admin panel shows a preview that somehow illustrates the *value*. Sometimes, it is tricky, when you need to how a value of callable type
* **callable type** - when the *setting value* is callable, so in code you need to call the value, for example `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS()`. The most of the *callable types* can be found in `content_settings.types.template`
* **content tags** - tags for the setting generated by the value of the setting.
* **db value** or **setting db value** - *raw value* that stored in db.
* **default value** or **setting default value** - `"mysubject"` - *raw value* that will be used for db initialization or for case when *db value* is not set.
* **definition** or **setting definition** - the example above shows the full setting definition. Includes *name* and *type definition*.
* **django settings** - as we use settings to short content settings, we will use django settings for actual django settings constants.
* **instance** or **setting instance** - the result of calling of *type definition*. The instance is responsable for converting, pasing, validating processes.
* **JSON value** or **setting JSON value** - JSON representation of the *value* for API. Generated by `json_view_value` of the *instance*
* **lazy value** or **setting lazy value** - *use setting* with *prefix* that returns *value* as a lazy object. Can be useful when you need save reference to the *value* in a global env before the *python object* generation. Example: `content_settings.lazy__FAVORITE_SUBJECTS`. Generated by `lazy_give` of the *instance*, see also `content_settings.types.lazy`
* **mixin** or **setting mixin** - in the *setting definition* you can extend *setting type* with a list of mixins using `mixin` function (the function and most of the available mixins can be found in `content_settings.types.mixins`). Example: `DAYS_WITHOUT_FAIL = mix(MinMaxValidationMixin, SimpleInt)("5", min_value=0, max_value=10, help="How many days without fail")` - *type* `SimpleInt` was extended with mixin `MinMaxValidationMixin` which adds new optional attributes `min_value` and `max_value` and validates if the *python object* is within a given range.
* **name** or **setting name** - `FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` - the unique name of your setting. Should always be upper cased. By the same name you can *use setting* and change it in Django Admin.
* **prefix** or **setting prefix** - it is a content setting method that can return other than *setting value*. For example  `content_settings.lazy__FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` - `lazy` is a prefix and the whole *use* returns *lazy value* of the setting `FAVORITE_SUBJECTS`. The `register_prefix` allows new prefix registration.
* **python object** or **setting python object** or **py object** - The object is generated by converting the raw value when starting the server (or when the raw value is changed). Generated by method `to_python` of the *setting instance*.
* **raw value** or **setting raw value** - The initial value, always string. This value is parsed/converted using the *setting instance*.
* **suffix** or **setting suffix** - extra atribute that extends `give` method that returns *value*. For example `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS__first` - `first` is a *suffix*. Suffixes and convinient for cases when you need to extract some other data from the *python object* not only *value*, or you need return *value* in a different way for a special cases.
* **type** or **setting type** - `SimpleStringsList` - All of the built in classes can be found in `content_settings.types`
* **type arguments** or **setting type arguments** - `comment_starts_with="//", help="my favorive songs subjects"`
* **type definition** or **setting type definition** - `SimpleStringsList("mysubject", comment_starts_with="//", help="my favorive songs subjects")`
* **use setting** or **setting use** - when you use setting in the python code `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` or in template `{{CONTENT_SETTINGS.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS}}`. All of those code examples return *setting value*
* **user defined types** - types that alloed to used for user defined settings. [More about it here](uservar.md).
* **user defined settings** or **user defined settings** - settings that are created in django admin by user (not by code). [More about it here](uservar.md).
* **value** or **setting value** - the value which will be returned when you *use setting*. Generated by the method `give` for the *setting instance* for each *use*. For the most basic types *value* is the same as *python object*.
