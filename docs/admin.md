# Enhancements to Admin Panel

## Introduction

The `django-content-settings` module enriches the Django admin panel with several user-friendly features, enhancing the ease of managing and navigating through the variables. This article outlines the functionalities specifically added to the Django admin interface.

## Features in the Admin Panel

### 1. Tag Filtering

In the admin panel, there's a list of tags registered in the variables. These tags can be used to filter the variables, making it easier to manage and locate specific settings.

### 2. User-Defined Tags

The right column of the table in the admin panel shows a list of user-tags.Users can add their own tags to variables. By default, this includes emoji like hearts and stars.

The list of available user-tags can be modified in Django's `settings.py`. A complete list of available settings for this feature can be found in the [full list of settings](settings.md).

### 3. Instant Preview on Change

When a user modifies a variable, a preview of this variable is immediately displayed below the editing field.

This instant preview feature allows users to see the effects of their changes in real time, enhancing the interactive experience within the admin panel.

## How These Features Benefit Admin Panel Users

1. **Improved Navigation**: With tag filtering, users can quickly find the variables they need without scrolling through the entire list.

2. **Personalization and Efficiency**: User-defined tags allow for a more personalized and efficient organization of variables, tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each admin user.

3. **Enhanced User Experience**: The instant preview feature provides immediate feedback on changes, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall user experience in managing content settings.
