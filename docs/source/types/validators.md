# class call_validator() [source](https://github.com/occipital/django-content-settings/blob/master/content_settings/types/validators.py#L5)

create a valiator that calls the function with the given args and kwargs.

# class gen_call_validator(call_validator) [source](https://github.com/occipital/django-content-settings/blob/master/content_settings/types/validators.py#L38)

Same as call_validator, but the args and kwargs are generated by a given function.

Create a valiator that calls the function that generates the args and kwargs, that will be used for the call.

The function will be regenerated every time when the validator is called.

The reason of having one is when you are not able to get possible args at the time of the creation of the validator.
